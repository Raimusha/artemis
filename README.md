# artemis
Game Overview
Artemis is an adventurous journey set in a mysterious dark forest. Your mission is to navigate through the dense woods and escape by reaching the other side of the map. The forest is full of challenges and obstacles that will test your agility and strategic thinking.

Objective
Your primary objective in Artemis is to escape the dark forest. This is achieved by navigating across the map to reach the far side. The journey is not straightforward; you'll need to leverage the tools at your disposal and overcome various obstacles.

Tools and Mechanics
Grapple Hook: A key tool for navigation and overcoming obstacles. The grapple hook provides an additional jump when it successfully connects to a tile, giving you the much-needed boost to traverse through difficult terrains. To use the grapple hook, press the Right Shift key.

Bounce Bush: These natural trampolines are scattered throughout the forest. When you jump on a Bounce Bush, you get a significant boost into the air. The height of the bounce is momentum-based, so the faster you're moving when you hit one, the higher you'll go.

Controls
Movement: Use standard directional keys or WASD for movement.
Jump: Press the Space Bar to jump.
Grapple Hook: Activate with the Right Shift key.
Restart: At any point, if you wish to restart the current level, simply press R.
Game Progression
If you fall off the map or find yourself stuck, the game will automatically restart the current level. This allows you to retry and approach the obstacles with a different strategy.
